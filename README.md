# mu-encoding
Implementation of tree-child compatibility algorithms for mu-representations of phylogenetic networks defined in my Final Degree Report

- The file ``compatibility.py`` contains an implementation for tree-child compatibility check and network reconstruction,
  as well as the algorithms for computing the maximum tree-child cover and the tree-child partition of a tree-child
  compatible network.
- The file ``generator.py``, on the other hand, contains an implementation of the generation algorithm that randomly
  generates a tree-child compatible set of the specified size and number of leafs.
